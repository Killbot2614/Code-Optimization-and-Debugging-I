# AIM
To write a program for blink LED with button using TinkerCAD
# COMPONENTS USED
Arduino Uno, LED
# PROCEDURE
1. Get Arduino Uno board from components
2. Get LED from components
3. LED has 2 sides. Positive side is connected to pin 13 of Arduino and Negative is connected to ground
# CODE
```
void setup(){
 pinMode(2,INPUT);
 pinMode(13,OUTPUT);}
void loop(){
  if(digitalRead(2)==1){
 digitalWrite(13,HIGH);}
 else{
   digitalWrite(13, LOW);}}
```
