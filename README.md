A relatively small collection of programs

## Usage

uh...Well...

**Step 1:** Find what you're looking for, by going through the directories(or using the search bar)

*The following steps are optional*

**Step 2:** Highlight the required code

**Step 3:** CTRL + C

**Step 4:** Navigate to wherever required

**Step 5:** CTRL + V

A tedious process but well worth it... I think
